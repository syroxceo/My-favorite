    <p> I like painting because you have creative freedom with it. You can paint whatever you want and however you want. You can express your emotions through painting. When you look at a peice of artwork, there is no wrong way of interpreting it. Another thing I like about painting is that you don't have to paint an image. You can draw lines on a canvas and it is still considered art. You can paint dots, you can splatter paint, you can paint the canvas a solid color, you can do whatever you want. It's never incomplete. I like that when you paint something, you're not restricted. You have freedom to do whatever you want and it is not going to be weird.</p>
